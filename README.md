# gitAutoUserConfig

Abraham Lincoln once said, *"if you use noahdotpy/gitAutoUserConfig you will immediately become 10x developer no cap."*

Inspired by [git-autoconfig](https://github.com/ShyykoSerhiy/git-autoconfig) vscode extension but designed to be accessible from anywhere via the command line.

## TODO:
  - Let user create new entry from program
  - Figure out how to get git's output to show as an error message if something goes wrong (like it's not a git repo)
 
## Implemented features:
  - Modify local repo's user config
